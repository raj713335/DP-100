train a `NYC Taxi Fare Predictor` machine learning model. We will train a multivariate regression model to predict taxi fares in New York City based on input features such as, number of passengers, trip distance, datetime, holiday information and weather information. Before we start, let's review the three main abstractions that are provided in the `MLlib`:<br><br>\n\n1. A **transformer** takes a DataFrame as an input and returns a new DataFrame with one or more columns appended to it.  \n  - Transformers implement a `.transform()` method.  \n2. An **estimator** takes a DataFrame as an input and returns a model, which itself is a transformer.\n  - Estimators implements a `.fit()` method.\n3.
